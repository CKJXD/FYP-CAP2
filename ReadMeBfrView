RUN the BankAnalyzer_Desktop.FINAL.code.py(Pyton) for view the final version on the apps , the Test code is useless, its just a draft for my pass code.
  and For the others GOOD_COMPANY_REALISTIC_TRANSACTIONS ,BAD_MONTH_UNHEALTHY_TRANSACTIONS and VERY_BAD_COMPANY_TRANSACTIONS
they are the CSV Exel file, 
GOOD_COMPANY_REALISTIC_TRANSACTIONS and BAD_MONTH_UNHEALTHY_TRANSACTION is same company , you can run the GOOD_COMPANY_REALISTIC_TRANSACTIONS for a view how a good and heathy company looks in the systems 
and after it , use the add file funtion to add the BAD_MONTH_UNHEALTHY_TRANSACTION csv to see how the system combine both file and analysis.

and VERY_BAD_COMPANY_TRANSACTIONS is a totally bad example to show.

the FYP-ZIP-TO-DOWNLOAD can direct download the zip file , so the code and CSV will show you in the file , dont have to key in one by one(PS i did download few extenssion,so if cant run do look for pyton extenssion)
